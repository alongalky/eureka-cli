# Contribute
The Eureka CLI is an open source project, and welcomes community contributions.

## Setting up
Clone the repo, and run `npm install` to download dependencies.

During development, if you want to use the local `eureka` commands instead of the ones installed globally, run: 
```bash
npm link
```
This will remain in effect until you run `npm unlink`.

## Code policy
Write unit tests, make sure `eslint .` is clean before sending pull requests to mv.
